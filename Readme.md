# Hate Speech Detection: Statistical vs. Deep Learning Approaches

## Overview

This project explores the performance of various statistical and deep learning-based embedding methods for hate speech detection. The analysis is conducted using two Jupyter notebooks: `NLP/Statistical models.ipynb` and `NLP/DEEP Learning Models.ipynb`. The focus is on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

- **Source**: `cardiffnlp/tweet_eval` hate-speech dataset from Hugging Face
- **Composition**: Training, validation, and test sets of tweets labeled for hate speech
- **Labels**: Binary classification (0: non-hate speech, 1: hate speech)

## Statistical Models

### Preprocessing and Dataset Setup

- **Libraries Used**: NLTK, scikit-learn, Gensim, pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn
- **Resources**: NLTK stopwords, lemmatization, GloVe embeddings (Twitter GloVe 25-dimensional)
- **Dataset**: `cardiffnlp/tweet_eval` hate-speech dataset

### Text Preprocessing

- **Functionality**:
  - Handles invalid input (returns empty string for non-string/blank text)
  - Converts to lowercase for uniformity
  - Cleans Twitter elements (replaces URLs with "URL", mentions with "USER", removes hashtags)
  - Removes special characters, numbers, and non-alphabetic tokens
  - Removes stopwords while retaining important negations ("not", "no", "never")
  - Applies lemmatization to reduce words to base forms
- **Safe Preprocessing**: Ensures error handling and adds a `processed_text` column.

### Embedding Methods

1. **Bag of Words (BoW)**

   - Uses `CountVectorizer` with a max of 5000 features
   - Creates sparse document-term matrices for training and testing datasets

2. **TF-IDF**

   - Employs `TfidfVectorizer` with a max of 5000 features
   - Weights terms by frequency and inverse document frequency

3. **Word2Vec**

   - Trains on tokenized tweets with vector size 100
   - Parameters: window size 5, min word count 2, 4 workers
   - Document vectors created by averaging word vectors

4. **FastText**

   - Similar parameters as Word2Vec (vector size 100, window 5, min count 2)
   - Better handling of out-of-vocabulary words through subword information

5. **GloVe**
   - Utilizes pre-trained Twitter GloVe embeddings (25-dimensional)
   - Document vectors created by averaging word vectors

### Model Training and Evaluation

- **Model**: Logistic Regression (random_state=42)
- **Metrics**:
  - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
  - Accuracy
  - Hate Speech Detection Rate (Recall for class 1)
  - False Positive Rate (1 - Recall for class 0)
  - ROC curves with AUC
  - Confusion matrices

| GloVe    | 57.6%    | 59.3%                      | 43.7%               | 54.1%            |
| BERT     | 76.3%    | 74.2%                      | 22.1%               | 75.8%            |

## Deep Learning Models

### Setup

- **Libraries**: Transformers, PyTorch, torch.nn, sklearn.metrics
- **Device**: Automatically utilizes GPU (CUDA) if available, otherwise CPU

  - Convert text to lowercase
  - Remove URLs, mentions, hashtags, and non-alphabetic characters
  - Remove extra spaces

### Dataset Preparation

- **Dataset**: Same TweetEval dataset used for statistical models
- **Custom Dataset Class**: `TextDataset` for tokenized text data with:
  - Tokenization using `tokenizer.encode_plus`

  - Linear classification head for binary classification
- **Forward Pass**:
  - Gets transformer outputs from input_ids and attention_mask
  - Uses [CLS] token representation (pooled output) for classification
  - Applies dropout and classification layer to produce logits

### Training Process

- **Optimizer**: AdamW with learning rate 2e-5
- **Loss Function**: CrossEntropyLoss
- **Training Loop**:
  - Batch processing with progress tracking via tqdm
